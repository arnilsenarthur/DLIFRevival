tutorial.greetings.0=Welcome to <§Don't Let It Fall§>!
tutorial.greetings.1=You are the floating boat <§captain§>, who needs to control a <§crew§> of crazy jelly-like workers!
tutorial.greetings.2=Your goal is to earn money delivering <§cargo§> boxes, while keep this ship <§balanced§>!
tutorial.greetings.3=To get started: Let me show you the basic controls.
tutorial.greetings.4=Use <§W§>, <§A§>, <§S§>, <§D§>, <§Left Shift§>, <§Space§> to control the camera!
tutorial.greetings.5=And now, let me teach you how to control your crewmates!

tutorial.boxes.0=Left click on a <§crewmate§> to select them
tutorial.boxes.1=Well done! Now click in a <§place on the ground§> to move to
tutorial.boxes.2=You're good! OH, a frog is dropping a box! Click on the <§box§> to grab it!

tutorial.boxes.fuelbox.0=This is a <§fuel box§>. You'll need to use it to <§refuel§> the ship!
tutorial.boxes.fuelbox.1=You can see the <§fuel indicator§> on the top-right corner of the screen
tutorial.boxes.fuelbox.2=If you run out of fuel your ship will not be able to <§self-balance§> anymore
tutorial.boxes.fuelbox.3=Click on the <§furnace§> to drop the box to refuel the ship
tutorial.boxes.fuelbox.4=Done! Now your ship is refueled!

tutorial.boxes.cargobox.0=Oh wait... The frog is bringing other box, let's check it out! <§Grab it!§>
tutorial.boxes.cargobox.1=This is a <§cargo box§>. You need to store them in your ship, while trying to keep the ship balanced!
tutorial.boxes.cargobox.2=You might be wondering: "Why don't I just drop it on the void?" ...
tutorial.boxes.cargobox.3=... but the answer is very simple: You need <§money§> to buy fuel and to <§pay your workers§>, so, you need to <§sell§> them!
tutorial.boxes.cargobox.4=Look at the top-left corner of your screen. That's your <§coin balance§>. Now you're quite poor... but don't worry!

tutorial.boxes.shop.0=It's not that hard to get money (at least, that's what I thought, hehehe...)
tutorial.boxes.shop.1=On the end of each day you'll hit a <§shop§>, where you can <§sell§> your <§cargo§> and buy other stuff.
tutorial.boxes.shop.2=On the left side of your screen you can see what items the next shop can buy.
tutorial.boxes.shop.3=Move all the cargo you want to sell to the <§sell area§> until the end of the day
tutorial.boxes.shop.4=But be careful, <§ALL§> the cargo you put there will be sold. If the shop does not buy an item, they'll just drop it into the void, so, you'll lose your cargo!
tutorial.boxes.shop.5=Now, move the cargo to the <§sell area§>. Just click on it!
tutorial.boxes.shop.6=Nice work! Now let's wait until the end of the day! You can see the clock on the top of the screen.

tutorial.shop.0=It's midnight! Welcome to the <§shop§>!
tutorial.shop.1=All your items have been sold! Now it's time to buy new stuff!
tutorial.shop.2=You can use the <§sliders§> on the middle of the screen to control what you want to do with your money!
tutorial.shop.3=<§First slider§>: Choose how many coins you want to spend with more <§fuel noxes§>. Each fuel box costs <§10§> coins!
tutorial.shop.4=<§Second slider§>: Choose how many coins you want to spend with new <§cargo§>. You will need to buy more cargo to sell it on the future, for more coins!
tutorial.shop.5=<§Third slider§>: If you need, you can hire more <§crewmates§>. Each crewmate costs <§100§> coins
tutorial.shop.6=But be smart. Each crew member receives a <§salary§> from time to time, which can end up being too expensive for you!
tutorial.shop.7=The last slider is <§automatic§>, and it shows how many money you will keep.

tutorial.shop.8=Choose all that you want, then click on the button <§done§>
tutorial.shop.9=Well done! Now the <§delivery frogs§> will drop everything you bought on the shop!

tutorial.salary.0=Now you know everything you need to know, so I'll leave you alone...
tutorial.salary.1=Wait... did you hear something? Oh! It's a crewmate! Let me hear him...
tutorial.salary.2=Hmm.... hmm.... I understand my friend...
tutorial.salary.3=HE SAID THAT YOU HAVEN'T PAID HIS <§SALARY§>!?!?
tutorial.salary.4=HOW CAN YOU BE SO MEAN TO A POOR CREWM-
tutorial.salary.5=Oh, wait, I haven't showed how to <§pay§> the crewmates right? Sorry, it was my fault!
tutorial.salary.6=Don't worry little friend, he'll pay you right now!
tutorial.salary.7=Let's pay him. click on the <§vault§> and he'll will grab his pay!
tutorial.salary.8=Oh that was close. He was so angry... If we took a little more time to pay him he would <§quit his job§>!
tutorial.salary.9=So, never forget to pay your <§crew§>! If you lose your crew, you will not be able to maintain your ship!

tutorial.end.0=I guess we are really done by now, so, good luck my friend!
tutorial.end.1=As we used to say: Arggggg! Goodbye Mate!
